# Passcode Generator

![CI](https://github.com/doamatto/phone-passcode-gen/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A simple passcode generator.

### Building
Ensure you have both [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed. Using Yarn, install `gulp-cli` globally (`yarn global add gulp-cli`), as well as install all the dependencies (`yarn`). Finally, simply run `gulp`. The applet will build into the `docs/` folder locally.

### Acknowledgments
The version found at [ppg.doamatto.xyz](https://ppg.doamatto.xyz) is hosted by Vercel.
